# polymarket-trading-system

This repository was initialized but currently contains no application source files.

## Why you may not see code on GitHub

The most common causes are:

1. The code exists locally but has not been committed.
2. Commits exist locally but have not been pushed to GitHub.
3. Work was done on a different branch and that branch has not been pushed.
4. The remote repository URL is not configured in the local clone.

## Quick recovery checklist

From your local project folder, run:

```bash
git status
git branch
git remote -v
```

If your files are local but uncommitted:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add project source"
```

If commits are local but not on GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin <your-branch>
```

If `origin` is missing:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/mihar123bot/polymarket-trading-system.git
git push -u origin main
```
